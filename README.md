# Algorithms
List of programming algorithms coded in Java

## Brute Force
A straightforward method of solving a problem that rely on sheer computing power and trying every possibility rather than advanced techniques to improve efficiency.
## Combo
## Divide and Conquer
Divide and Conquer is a strategy of solving a large problem by
1. Breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems
2. Solving the sub-problems, and
3. Combining them to get the desired output.
## Dynamic
Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later. This simple optimization reduces time complexities from exponential to polynomial.

For example, if we write simple recursive solution for Fibonacci Numbers, we get exponential time complexity and if we optimize it by storing solutions of subproblems, time complexity reduces to linear.
